# My Skills Showcase

This repository contains files that showcase my skills in various areas including Ruby on Rails, Javascript, APIs, SwiftUI

## Files

1. `app/controllers/landlords_controller.rb`: This file contains an example of my LandlordsController and the parameters I used to query information, conditionals, and implementing Ruby Gems that could execute the pagination.

This project has been deployed at (https://mylandlordratings.org)

2. `db/seeds.rb`: This folder contains all of the seed information that was fed to the database for this SeedSphere application. 

I am fairly proud of this code since it took me a while to gather this information and figure out how to input into the database once hosted online. Here is a snippet of the code I used to set seed categories and the seeds' information that would be stored in the database.

Here is a screenshot of the website that is now deployed and continously maintained by me.

3. `to-do list/ContentView.swift`: This file contains a the content view code for a simple to do list application I've been working on lately and plan on keep making more robust as time goes by to strenghten my swift skills.

At the moment, this is a project that lives in my computer for personal use.

4. `app/controllers/solutions_controller.rb`: This file contains a code for a controller, I made this app using OpenAIs API. I wanted to create a short children's story teller. I was able to give the API a role, which i set as "Dr.Seuss". This was particularly an interesting project because I had to figure out how to set the enviroments to private so my API keys were not out in public.

5. `src/SnakeGame.js`: This is the main folder where all of the code for a small game in React.js that I made for fun.
