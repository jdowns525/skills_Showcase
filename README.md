3. `to-do list/ContentView.swift`: This file contains a the content view code for a simple to do list application I've been working on lately and plan on keep making more robust.
4. `app/controllers/solutions_controller.rb`: This file contains a code for a controller, I made this app using OpenAIs API. I wanted to create a short children's story teller. I was able to give the API a role, which i set as "Dr.Seuss". This was particularly an interesting project because I had to figure out how to set the enviroments to private so my API keys were not out in public.
